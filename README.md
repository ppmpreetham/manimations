# manimations

The manim animations I make for my [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzhOpCj6T1Gp3gsxhv8xfyA) and Personal Projects.

This almost entirely consists of scenes generated using the library [Manim](https://github.com/3b1b/manim).  See also the community maintained version at [ManimCommunity](https://github.com/ManimCommunity/manim/)
